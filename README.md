# Connect Four

This is my submission for the Connect Four project as assigned by The Odin Project

## Assignment
Hopefully everyone has played Connect Four at some point (if not, see the Wikipedia page). It’s a basic game where each player takes turns dropping pieces into the cage. Players win if they manage to get 4 of their pieces consecutively in a row, column, or along a diagonal.
The game rules are fairly straightforward and you’ll be building it on the command line like you did with the other games.
